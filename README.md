# Autoencoder-for-image-denoising

Input data is the 2 datasets of 30x30 block imaginary calorimeter with a single shower: the dataset with noisy images and 
the one with corrensponded them clean images.

The task is to build the mpdel that can learn from input data to remove noise from the images.
